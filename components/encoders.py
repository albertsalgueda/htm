"""
--- THE RULES ---
1.- Semantically similar data should result with SDRs with overlapping active bits
2.- The same input should produce the same output ( deterministic ) 
3.- Output should have the same dimensionality all the time
4.- The output should have similar sparsity for all inputs and have enough one-bits to handle noise and sub-sampling
