                                            periodically, each minicolumn looks at the

                                            to

                                            falls below this, all permanence values get
                                            boosted by synapse_perm_inc. raising
                                            permanences before inhibition allows a cell

                                            previously learned inputs are no longer ever
                                            active or when vast majority of inputs are

        duty_cycle_period:                  period used to calculate duty cycles. higher
                                            values means it takes longer to respond in
                                            changes in boosting or synapses per
                                            connected cell. shorter values make it more
                                            unstable and likely to oscillate.
                                            default ``1000``.

        boost_strength:                     a number >= 0.0 that is used to control the
                                            strength of boosting. boosting increases as
                                            a function of boost_strength. encourages
                                            minicolumns to have similar active duty
                                            cycles as their neighbors, which will lead
                                            to more efficient use of minicolumns. too
                                            much boosting may lead to instability of
                                            spatial pooler outputs.
